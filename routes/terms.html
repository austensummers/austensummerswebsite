      <p class="animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp delay-1">
        By taking any Game Transformation program you agree to and accept the following terms, conditions, and notices (we reserve the right to change, update, and revise these terms of use at our sole discretion. Check back often to review any updated terms). Please read the following terms and conditions carefully:
      </p>

      <p class="mt-5">
        <b> 1. Confidentiality </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand that the identities of all staff and participants are to be kept confidential. Privacy is important to attendees and staff. I agree to not use any audio or video recording devices during training. I understand I may be audio or video recorded by the Game Transformation team. All footage of you in-field will be available on a flash drive for you to take home.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-5">
        <b> 2. Non-Disclosure </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand these courses, marketing materials related to them, and their content contain copyrights, trademarks, and other original works of Game Transformation, and that any duplication or derivative works are unlawful. I agree that I will not disclose to any such competing individual or company any of the content I am exposed to on the program or use of the information I learn in the program as the basis for a competing business. This material is confidential, and for my personal private use only. Recording any portion of this program will result in being removed from this program without refund.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-5">
        <b> 3. Non-Compete </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        I do not and will not own, operate or work for a company or internet website that teaches men how to be successful with women and dating for 4 years after attending Immersion or Mentorship in any city. I will forfeit to Game Transformation any revenue earned from operating or working for a company or internet website that teaches men how to be successful with women and dating during the 4 year period, and I am still obligated to keep all trade secrets confidential.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-5">
        <b> 4. Limitation of Liability </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand and agree that the ideas, concepts, techniques and views that I will be exposed to are opinions only, to be used for entertainment purposes only, and not to be considered as professional or legal advice. I agree never to use any of the content that I learn in an unlawful manner under any circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree that Game Transformation, its instructors, or its principal shall not be liable in any way whatsoever for any damages as a result of using or my inability to use the concepts I learn at this training and other third-party providers used, or any other product or service you are exposed to as a result of my relationship with Game Transformation or its instructors. I agree to forgo litigation and settle the matter using Binding Arbitration if a conflict should arise between Game Transformation (including its staff and principal). Game Transformation retains the right to refuse service and training to anyone at our discretion at any time.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-5">
        <b>
          5. Payment, Cancellation, Refund, and Transfer Policy for Immersion
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Final payment is due 1 month prior to Immersion. Given the level of commitment necessary to reach your goals, there are no refunds whatsoever. This also helps you “burn the boats,” so you’re completely invested in the program, do the assignments, and accelerate your personal growth and results. However, you can transfer your Immersion program to another date:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you transfer 30 days or more prior to the first day of your Immersion: $100 transfer fee
        </li>
        <li>
          If you transfer within 30 days of the first day of your Immersion: $500 transfer fee
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt-5">
        <b> 6. Cancellation and Refund Policy + Transfer Policy for Mentorship Programs </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        For all programs worldwide there are no refunds whatsoever, as you immediately gain access to the online course and group chat. This also helps you “burn the boats,” so you’re completely invested in the program, do the assignments, and accelerate your personal growth and results. There is no “credit” system in place for taking back payments for the time and service you do not use. You may pause your involvement in the program, but you may not pause payments. (E.g. Taking the Mentorship program in January, pausing in February due to traveling with a girl, then continuing the program in March and April. Payments would be due and end in February, but program access would end in April).
      </p>

      <p class="mt-5">
        <b> 7. Client Standards </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Clients must comply to the standards of the program outlined by the coach which may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Approaching women every week, journaling, and messaging women</li>
        <li>
          Having basic daily habits such as meditation, eating healthy, exercising, and personal hygiene
        </li>
        <li>Staying positive and solution oriented instead of negative or problem focused</li>
        <li>Any mission or task that is given to the client by the coach</li>
        <li>Game Transformation reserves the right to remove people from the trainings for any reason, including, but not limited to: disrupting the group dynamic, making excuses, negativity, not meeting weekly standards (there is a 3 strike rule with Mentorship)</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt-5">
